            <p>My name is Tassiana Groot, I as born and raised in Aruba. I have been living in the Netherlands since 2010. I currently work as an air quality specialist at an engineering firm, but looking for potential options to make a career switch into software development.</p>

            <h2>What has my experience been until now?</h2>
            <p>When I first applied to the webdeveloper course, I was planning on starting immediately as to not rack up any delays for which I'd have to rush through the material in order to finish within three months. 
                On the 10th of December, I flew to Aruba to spend three weeks with family. I planned on giving myself a headstart during this break because of all the free time I thought I'd have. 
                Unfortunately, the first week turned out to be super hectic due to certain responsibilities with family and work. 
                This means I was not able to have as much of a headstart as I'd hoped.</p>
            <p>Now that I have finally started, the course is going quite smoothly. I still have a long way to go, but I do believe I will get there soon</p>
